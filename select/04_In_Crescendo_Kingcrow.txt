There,
She stands,
Alone
The girl facing the mirror
Is right to close her eyes before she cries
And now,
She knows
Her life will be so different
Before she was still young she can't turn back

There,
She stands,
Alone
The girl facing the mirror
Has ran away from home
No time to go
And now
She knows
There is no happy ending
And time repeats to take her far away

His brown eyes
And a colour she will never forget
On, the, ground
Feeling a swell all the time that they shared
What, went wrong
Now that the belly comes out of the shirt?
She's, afraid
What she will give to be told it's okay
(Falling)
(Falling)

Please don't judge me baby
When you are grown up
No you still don't know me
But my live is yours
Please don't judge me honey
When you are grown up
I just felt you're moving
Can you hear my voice?
I know you'll be the change to find the love I never had
It's hard but not too late to find a way out of my mess
I know you'll be the change to find the love I never had
It's hard but not too late to find a way out of my mess
(My mess)

I
I won't run away
I can't get away with what I used to hide
All I really need
Was the only thing I couldn't find
I won't run away
I can't get away with what I used to hide
All I really need
Was the only thing I couldn't find
I won't run away
I can't get away with what I used to hide
All I really need
Was the only thing I couldn't find
I know you'll be the chance to find the love I never had
It's hard but not too late to find a way out of my mess
I know you'll be the chance to find the love I never had
It's hard but not too late to find a way out of my mess
My mess

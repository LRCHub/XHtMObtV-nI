Back To Memphis
If i never saw you
You'd still live in my dreams
Calling out from stages
And music magazines
? If i were a painter
You'd be green and gold
Carved out of matches
But broken out of stone
? Taken from the fire of your fiddle
Words of unspoken, blinding truth
If i couldn't see it, i was lost in my youth
But i'm going back to memphis - after you.
? If i could have seen you
With blood on your bones
Poison in your fingers
But music in your soul
? You could have been my lover
Taught me everything i know
But now we are your children
Your flowers in the snow
? But all you ever wanted was to see the heart of the city, oh
And all you ever got was hand to mouth
So i know you'll be walking for a long, long time
Cause you're going back to memphis - heading south.
? Brothers till the night came
And whispered in the pines
Tempting me with secrets
To play a game with time
? Now i feel you in the walls
And i know you're in the air
And it's just like i can touch you
You're living everywhere
? But all you ever wanted was to be in the heart of the city, oh
And all you ever got was handed out
So i know we'll be walking for a long, long time
Cause we're going back to memphis - heading south
Going back to memphis - heading south.?
